# lf2bf-microscopy
A novel two-stage pipeline transforming inherently uninterpretable lens-free holograms into high-fidelity brightfield microscopy images via Paired Autoencoders and Pix2PixHD, with rigorous morphology preservation and GAN “hallucination” evaluation using eigencountour-based cluster analysis and difference-map χ² tests.
